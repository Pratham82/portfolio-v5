Here's how I manage my Git workflowâ€”fast, clean, and without switching between tabs:

## ðŸ”¹ Create Branch

Using oh-my-zsh shortcut:

```bash
gcb feat/add-company-logo
```

(No more typing long `git checkout -b` commands.)

## ðŸ”¹ Make Commits

Using **git-cz** (Commitizen) for consistent, structured commits â€” picking the right type (`feat`, `fix`, etc.) and writing clear messages.

```bash
git cz
```

## ðŸ”¹ Create Pull Request

This is where it gets powerful:

```bash
gh pr create --base main
```

With GitHub CLI, I can open a PR from the terminal, get the link instantly, and skip the GitHub UI altogether.

## âœ… Why I love this:

- No context switching
- Clean commit history
- PR in seconds, ready to share or merge

**P.S.** I use `gh` CLI only for PRs â€” everything else is regular git + terminal + zsh.
