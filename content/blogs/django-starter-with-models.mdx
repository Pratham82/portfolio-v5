This is my first post on Dev.to. I'm trying out new things, and I came acress django and the setup seemed bit confusing so I am making this tutorial/blog for the same topic.

This basic starter for django I have gone through the steps of creating a project and app for future reference. This is a django application for saving employee information and rendering it to the webpage.

### Pre-requisites software to be installed:

- Python
- Django

<br />
Django installation:

```
‚ûú python -m pip install Django
```

<br />

## Steps for creating the same app:

### 1. Creating new site

```
‚ûú django-admin startproject employee_site
```

<br />

### 2. Creating new app

```
‚ûú django-admin startapp employees
```

- ‚ùóÔ∏è In the whole doc I will be referring **employee_site** as **site** and **employees** as **app**

- ‚ùóÔ∏è In the shell commands I have used **python3** since I have a linux OS. If you are using windows use **python** instead of **python3**

<br />

### 3. Creating new view

Add new view in **views.py** of app
Create **urls.py** file in "app" directory
Copy paste the following code in view.py

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

# Create your views here.
def employees_page(request):
   return HttpResponse('Hello World')
```

Add the url for view in **urls.py**

```python
from django.urls import path
from .import  views
urlpatterns = [
	path('',views.employees_page, name="employees")
]
```

Go to **urls.py** in "site" and add new path to the app using include method.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path,include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('employees/', include("employees.urls")),
]

```

Now add your app name in **settings.py** inside the **site**

```python

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'exmployees',
    'django.contrib.admin',
....
```

Now we can go the url mentioned in the app we can see the response added in **views.py**

```url
http://localhost:8000/employees/
```

<br />

### 4. Adding models

Go to **models.py** in "app" and create new model:

```python
from django.db import models

# Create your models here.
class employees_db(models.Model):
	emp_id = models.AutoField
	firstName = models.CharField(max_length=30)
	lastName = models.CharField(max_length=30)
	dept = models.CharField(max_length=30)
	salary = models.IntegerField()

	def __str__(self):
	 return self.firstName
```

For adding the model inside to the **site** we have to add the **appConfig** inside the **site's** **settings.py**

For copying the config first go to **apps.py** in "app" copy the "AppNameConfig" in our example it is **EmployeesConfig**. It wil be created automatically.

```python
from django.apps import AppConfig


class EmployeesConfig(AppConfig):
    name = 'employees'

```

Now go to **settings.py** in site and go to installed apps list and add "appName.apps.AppNameConfig" in our example it is **EmployeesConfig**.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'employees.apps.EmployeesConfig',
    'django.contrib.admin',
    ...
]
```

Go to terminal and update the migrations and migrate. Make sure you are in the same directory as **manage.py**

```
‚ûú python3 manage.py makemigrations
‚ûú python3 manage.py migrate
```

Now our models are added to the database.

<br />

### 5. Accessing the admin panel

First we have to create a new super user

```
‚ûú python3 manage.py createsuperuser
```

Add the appropriate info and password
And Run server again

```
‚ûú python3 manage.py runserver
```

Go to /admin page and add the admin name and password

```
http://localhost:8000/admin
```

<br />

### 6. Registering the models

In order to use the models we have to register it

For doing that go to **admin.py** in **app**

Import our newly created model

Register the model
Code :

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import employees_db

# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(employees_db)
```

Restart the server
We can check the models filed in our admin panel now

<br />

### 7. Creating templates and adding it to views

Create new folder named "templates" in app directory and add new html file

```
‚ûú mkdir templates
‚ûú touch index.html
```

Now go to **views.py** in our app and add return statement which renders our html page in **templates**

```
return render(request, 'index.html',dbData)
```

<br />

### 8. Fetching the data from models

First go to admin page:

```
http://localhost:8000/admin
```

Now you can see that **employees_db** has been created we can click on it and add new employees

Once it is done go to **view.py** in **app**

Now first we will import our **model** which is **employees_db** and then
store the **db data** to one variable and pass that data to the template as a third parameter.

Code:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
from employees.models import employees_db

# Create your views here.
def employees_page(request):

	# fetching data from models
	dbData = {"data" : employees_db.objects.all()}

	return render(request, 'index.html',dbData)
```

Now we can access data from Database through **dbData** variable.

<br />

### 9. Rendering data to templates

Go to **templates\/** and open **index.html**

We can use the **data** key passed in the **dbData** object/dictionary.

We loop over it and render the values of attributes for eg. **emp.firstName** will give us firstName value.

```html
<div class="container-style">
  {% for emp in data %}
  <div class="emp-card">
    <p class="id"><b>ID:</b> {{emp.id}}</p>
    <p class="name"><b>Name:</b> {{emp.firstName}} {{emp.lastName}}</p>
    <p class="dept"><b>Dept:</b> {{emp.dept}}</p>
    <p class="salary"><b>Salary:</b> $ {{emp.salary}}</p>
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```

You can add the optional styling which is included in my **index.html** page.

<br />

ü•≥ Our app is now completed üéâ

<br />

### For running the app:

```
python3 manage.py runserver
```

### Check the **employees** page. For checking go to the following link:

```
http://localhost:8000/employees/
```

### In the end our site will something like this:

### Conclusion

So far we have learned have learned how to create a project and app in django and create models. We also learned how to create an admin and add new properties to the models, then rendering the properties to our html page.
